üìù Problem Statement: ATM Cash Withdrawal System

A bank ATM machine dispenses cash in denominations of ‚Çπ2000, ‚Çπ500, and ‚Çπ100.

You are required to design a program that simulates the withdrawal process.

Requirements:

The user enters the amount they wish to withdraw.

The program must check if the amount is a multiple of ‚Çπ100.

If not, display an error message and terminate.

If valid, the ATM should dispense the amount using the minimum number of notes, starting from the highest denomination (‚Çπ2000) down to the lowest (‚Çπ100).

The program should then display:

Number of ‚Çπ2000 notes,

Number of ‚Çπ500 notes,

Number of ‚Çπ100 notes.

Constraints:

Input must be a positive integer.

Input must be ‚â• 100 and a multiple of 100.

Denominations available: {2000, 500, 100} only.

Example 1:

Input: 3700
Output:
2000 notes: 1
500 notes: 3
100 notes: 2

Example 2:
Input: 2550
Output:
Invalid amount. Please enter in multiples of 100.
