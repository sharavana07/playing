# üçî Restaurant Order Billing System ‚Äì Problem Statement

### Context

You are tasked with developing a simple **restaurant billing application** for a small food corner. The program should allow customers to place multiple orders, calculate the bill, and apply discounts if applicable.

---

### Requirements

1. **Display a Menu**

   * The restaurant has 5 items with fixed prices:

     * Pizza ‚Äì ‚Çπ250
     * Burger ‚Äì ‚Çπ120
     * Pasta ‚Äì ‚Çπ150
     * Sandwich ‚Äì ‚Çπ100
     * Coffee ‚Äì ‚Çπ80

2. **Take Orders Using Switch Case**

   * The customer selects an item by entering a number (1‚Äì5).
   * The program asks for the **quantity** of the selected item.
   * Based on the choice, the cost is added to the bill.

3. **Multiple Orders with Loop**

   * After each order, the program asks:
     *‚ÄúDo you want to order more? (Y/N)‚Äù*
   * If the customer chooses **Yes**, the program repeats.
   * If the customer chooses **No**, the ordering process ends.

4. **Bill Calculation with Discount**

   * Compute the **total bill amount**.
   * If the bill is **greater than ‚Çπ500**, apply a **10% discount**.
   * Otherwise, no discount is applied.

5. **Final Output**

   * Display the **final payable amount**.
   * Show a thank-you message at the end.

### Learning Outcomes

By solving this problem, you will practice:

* Using a **switch case** for menu-driven selection.
* Using a **for loop (or while loop)** to repeat orders until the customer exits.
* Applying **if conditions** for logical decision-making (discount check).
* Handling **real-world style input/output** in C++.

---

‚ö° This problem simulates a **real billing counter system**, making it practical while strengthening your **control flow** concepts in C++.

Would you like me to **make it a step-by-step assignment** (breaking it into smaller subtasks you solve one by one), so it feels like building the system gradually?
