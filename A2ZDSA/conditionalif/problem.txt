### ðŸš¦ Problem Statement: *"Smart Traffic Fine Calculator"*

A city has implemented a smart traffic system that calculates fines based on **vehicle speed** and **driver type**.

Write a C++ program that:

1. Takes as input:

   * Vehicle speed (integer)
   * Driver type (`N` for normal citizen, `V` for VIP, `P` for police)

2. Applies the following rules:

   * Speed â‰¤ 60 â†’ No fine.
   * Speed 61â€“80 â†’ Fine â‚¹500 for normal drivers, but only â‚¹200 for VIPs. Police are exempt.
   * Speed 81â€“100 â†’ Fine â‚¹2000 for normal drivers, â‚¹1000 for VIPs. Police are exempt.
   * Speed > 100 â†’ Fine â‚¹5000 for normal drivers, â‚¹2500 for VIPs. Police are exempt.

3. The program should **output the fine amount** or `"No fine"` accordingly.
